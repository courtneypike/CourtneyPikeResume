        <h3>How long have I been playing the piano?</h3>
        <p>I have been playing the piano for about 6 years now. I started getting lessons one of the first months I moved out of my family home to go to college. I got lessons at a local place for about 3 years before I started taking lessons at my university. Now, to this day, I still take lessons here at BU with a student who is receiving a masters in piano.</p>
