    <h1>Biography/ Cover Letter</h1>
    <p>
        At the University of Nevada, Reno, I graduated Magna Cum Laude with a Bachelor’s degree in Information Systems. After receiving my degree in May 2020, I am now earning my degree in Computer Information Systems with a concentration in Computer Networks.
        <br>At UNR, I completed a Database Design and Implementation course. In this course, I spent over 20 hours a week working in Microsoft SQL Server creating tables, stored procedures, and running queries. Through this course, I learned that I enjoy maintaining databases and that I am talented at it as well. I have also completed courses in Database Design and Implementation, Computer Science, Internet Programming, Data Communications, Computer Applications (Microsoft Access, Microsoft Excel), and Project Management.
        <br>At my previous position as both a Support Specialist I and Support Specialist II at Harrah’s Reno, I have worked with both old and new Windows technology. Older technology, such as Windows XP, has provided me the framework in Windows operating systems, which I have used to update computers to current technology. For example, I created a Windows 10 image that I applied to over 50 computers within the hotel that were previously running Windows XP. I am v ery comfortable working in a Windows environment and have one year's worth of professional experience in this.
        <br>The responsibilities that this position offers align with the career goals that I have set for myself. It would add to my experience in Information Technology and Database Administration, as I am currently achieving a Computer Information Systems Master’s Degree that has a concentration in Computer Networks.
