            <p>
                At the University of Nevada, Reno, I graduated Magna Cum Laude with a Bachelor’s degree in Information Systems. After receiving my degree in May 2020, I am now earning my degree in Computer Information Systems with a concentration in Computer Networks.<br><br>
                <br>At UNR, I completed a Database Design and Implementation course. In this course, I spent over 20 hours a week working in Microsoft SQL Server creating tables, stored procedures, and running queries. Through this course, I learned that I enjoy maintaining databases and that I am talented at it as well. I have also completed courses in Database Design and Implementation, Computer Science, Internet Programming, Data Communications, Computer Applications (Microsoft Access, Microsoft Excel), and Project Management.<br><br>
                <br>At my previous position as both a Support Specialist I and Support Specialist II at Harrah’s Reno, I have worked with both old and new Windows technology. Older technology, such as Windows XP, has provided me the framework in Windows operating systems, which I have used to update computers to current technology. For example, I created a Windows 10 image that I applied to over 50 computers within the hotel that were previously running Windows XP. I am very comfortable working in a Windows environment and have one year's worth of professional experience in this.<br><br>
                <br>At my current position as a Technologies Engineer II at Boston University, I am tasked with inventing innovative ideas for the MET community, as well as creating custom code to make our communities systems more efficent. We work with Blackboard systems, both in the interface and through accessing their database, to create new innovative solutions for the MET community.<br><br>
                <br>The responsibilities that this position offers align with the career goals that I have set for myself. It would add to my experience in Information Technology and Database Administration, as I am currently achieving a Computer Information Systems Master’s Degree that has a concentration in Computer Networks.
