        My name is Courtney Pike, and this is my site to demonstrate some of my professional experience and hobbies. <br><br>

        During my Master's degree at Boston University, I acquired advanced knowledge in computer networks, information systems analysis, network security, and IT strategy and management. I also gained hands-on experience in web application development, information structures with Python, and data visualization in R. I graduated with a cumulative GPA of 3.70/4.0. <br><br>

        In addition to my Master's degree, I graduated Magna Cum Laude from the University of Nevada, Reno, with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration, Information Systems. My coursework included Database Design and Implementation, Computer Science, Internet Programming, Introduction to Engineering Design, Data Communications, Cyber Security, Business Management, and Economics. I achieved a cumulative GPA of 3.94/4.0.<br><br>

        During my time as a Technologies Engineer with the Educational Technology and Innovation (ETI) department at Boston University (BU), I focused on developing my skills in programming languages and frameworks, including JavaScript, SQL, HTML/CSS.js, and jQuery/AJAX. In this position, I created various HTML front-end applications that utilized Node.js and jQuery API functionality to extract data from our internal database and BU’s Learning Management System (LMS) data warehouse, which was then displayed in a user-friendly manner for faculty and students. Additionally, I gained practical experience in building back-end programs, as I built an emailing system with Node.js, SQL, and Nodemailer. This system automatically sent out emails to students based on their progress in BU's LMS course sites. I also had the opportunity to lead a team responsible for providing technical support for our college’s (MET) LMS, which was a critical aspect of this position as we facilitated over 300 courses each semester.<br><br>

        Additionally, my internship as a Data Analyst at Bot Watt taught me valuable skills in data analysis and web scraping. I gained hands-on experience with Puppeteer, JavaScript, Node.js, and Sequelize ORM and learned to design, implement, and maintain data models that fit business needs. At this position, I wrote several web scraping programs to mine data from clean energy data sources routinely and integrated scraped data into the front-end by creating HTML pages that pull from the database using Web API routing, React, and Express.js.<br><br>

        I have developed several projects that demonstrate my proficiency in various programming languages and frameworks, as well as my passion for full-stack development. An example of a project I have completed is <a href="coverify-stream.com">coverify-stream.com</a> (<a href="/coverify.html">Coverify</a>), a Spotify-approved application that pulls user streaming and profile data to make a user's Spotify history into a magazine cover. Coverify is a Spotify-approved application that uses express.js, serverless HTTP, and Netlify lambda through a middleware router to handle OAuth 2.0 framework with Spotify. As the sole developer, I built the front-end and design with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. The website has had 1000+ visitors since its launch in April 2023.<br><br>
